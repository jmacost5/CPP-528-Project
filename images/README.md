**Building a Neighborhood Change Database:**
In this project we are ultimately interested in building models to explain neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010. Census data is central to this analysis, using the harmonized Longitudinal Tracts Data Base. 

**Packages used:**
Thanks to the renv package, you can install the necessary R packages by running this line of code:
   #### restore a project's dependencies from the renv.lock file (located in the root directory)
