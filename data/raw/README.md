#Raw Files

All of the raw data files will go in the raw folder. By “raw” we mean the data as it arrived from whatever site we retrieved it from, or the file exactly how it was exported from a custom data collection tool like an online survey program.

Anything that documents the data collection process lives here. Also includes the data dictionaries used in this analysis. 

Common errors at the download step include things like making an error on a Census variable name (easy to do since the raw names are things like *B19013*). Or alternatively, incorrectly applying a filter like geography or time-period during a download.
