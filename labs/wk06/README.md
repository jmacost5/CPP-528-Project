# CPP-528-Project Week 6
Created a single .R file that is used in both Lab 04 and Lab 05. Now the import::here() statement pulls from this singular .R file that is referenced in both Lab 04 and Lab 05.

By creating a unified .R file, you can be assured that whatever happened in that file is feeding into both documents. This also makes it easier to spot any errors that may occur.
