Lab 02 - Data Wrangling
The end goal of data wrangling is for the data to be clean and easy to use during the analytical stage of the project. For this lab you will add meaningful
metadata about the LTDB dataset to a machine-readable concordance file that will be used to greatly improve the usability of the data.



Part 1: Data Concordance
Download the data concordance spreadsheet that was created from the steps described above and store it within the data/rodeo directory. 
You will see that it has all of the information about variable changes over time, but it has incomplete meta-data that describes the variables.


Part 2: Build a Variable Filter
Part of the challenge of working with this dataset is its size. It’s hard to keep track of dozens of variables at once,
especially when the abbreviations are not very helpful and many concepts are closely related.

ONE: Filter variables by theme or group. Write a function that takes as an argument one or more of the groups that you just created in the 
concordance file under the “category” field and returns all of the variables associated with that group.

TWO: Create a function that searches variable descriptions for a specific string and returns any variables that match. 

THREE: Create a function to filter variables by time periods. Specifically, the user will specify the time periods of interest for the study and 
the function will identify all variables that have measures for those periods.
