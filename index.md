## Introduction & Research Question
This report discusses possible influences of neighborhood change through the use of census data. The variables chosen for the analysis as indicators of gentrification were percent college educated, percent Black population, and percent unemployed. Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) models were used to assess the impact of federal programs on positive neighborhood growth.
