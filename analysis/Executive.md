# Executive Summary

## Overview & Research Question:

In this project we are ultimately interested in building models to explain neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010 in the United States of America.
Neighborhood change is a term to describe processes of physical and socioeconomic change within and in-between neighborhoods [1].

The research question presented was if two federal tax programs motivated positive growth to revitalize neighborhoods between the yearsof 2000-2010. 

The two programs analyzed were:

Low Income Housing Tax Credits [(LIHTC)](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-low-income-housing-tax-credit-and-how-does-it-work)

New Market Tax Credits  [(NMTC)](https://www.novoco.com/resource-centers/new-markets-tax-credits/nmtc-basics/new-markets-tax-credit-program-summary).

## Data:

Census data is central to this analysis. We have begun using the harmonized Longitudinal Tracts Data Base (LTDB) to identify potential variables as indicators of 
gentrification as well as Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) data, and New Market Tax Credit data (NMTC) for the tax programs.

## Methods:

We used a regression model to predict change in median home value from 2000 to 2010. The dependent variable in our model is the median home value. It is a good price mechanism to capture the state of a neighborhood because they “price in” all of the characteristics of the house as well as the features of the neighborhood and surrounding city, the independent variables were percentaege of unemployment, percentage of black residents and percentage of college graduates.

We used the a difference-in-difference model to study the effect of Tax programs mentiioned above.

## Results:

Our variables percent college educated, percent Black population, and percent unemployed were significant variables were significant to the model but we cannot say that they are the only or the main indicators as it is a complex formula including many variables that each have an impact on the results.

One surprising finding of this study was that the median homevalue in many communities was lower in the tracts that had received both the LIHTC and the NMTC questionning here both the efficiency and the success factors of theses programs
