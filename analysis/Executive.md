# Executive Summary

## Overview & Research Question:

In this project we are ultimately interested in building models to explain neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010 in the United States of America.
Neighborhood change is a term to describe processes of physical and socioeconomic change within and in-between neighborhoods [a].

The research question presented was if two federal tax programs motivated positive growth to revitalize neighborhoods between the yearsof 2000-2010. 
The two programs analyzed were:

Low Income Housing Tax Credits [(LIHTC)](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-low-income-housing-tax-credit-and-how-does-it-work)

New Market Tax Credits  [(NMTC)](https://www.novoco.com/resource-centers/new-markets-tax-credits/nmtc-basics/new-markets-tax-credit-program-summary).

## Data:

Census data is central to this analysis. We have begun using the harmonized Longitudinal Tracts Data Base data to identify potential variables as indicators of 
gentrification. 

## Methods:

The dependent variable in our model is the median home value beacause they are a good price mechanism to capture the state of a neighborhood because they “price in” all of the characteristics of the house as well as the features of the neighborhood and surrounding city.

## Results:

The first surprising finding of this study was that the median homevalue in many communities was lower in the tracts that had received boththe LIHTC and the NMTC.
Determining which variables have the most impact on gentrification is a difficult task and one that may not be used universally to apply to every neighborhood in the U.S. Our analysis showed that percent college educated, percent Black population, and percent unemployed were significant variables but likely do not capture the whole picture.

# Neighborhood Change

## Gentrification

Gentrification is a complex issue. It can cause disruption in a
community and make residents feel as though they are no longer welcome
in areas where they have lived (for, sometimes, generations). Local
residents frequently worry that gentrification will lead to negative
impacts such as forced displacement, a fostering of discriminatory
behavior by people in power, and a focus on spaces that exclude
low-income individuals and people of color.[6]

Gentrification has increased over the last few decades.[7] High-income
and college-educated individuals increasingly have chosen to relocate to
dense, urban neighborhoods. Increased attention has led to an increase
in data-driven studies to understand this issue and help protect the
original residents. The byproduct has been more studies showing the
complicated nature of this problem and studies that show positive
outcomes for some communities going through this change. This
gentrification process reverses decades of urban decline and could bring
broad new benefits to cities through a growing tax base, increased
socioeconomic integration, and improved amenities (Vigdor 2002; Diamond
2016). Moreover, a large neighborhood effects literature shows that
exposure to higher-income neighborhoods has important benefits for
low-income residents, such as improving the mental and physical health
of adults and increasing the long-term educational attainment and
earnings of children (Kling et al. 2007; Ludwig et al. 2012; Chetty et
al. 2016; Chetty and Hendren 2018a,b; Chyn 2018). Gentrification thus
has the potential to dramatically reshape the geography of opportunity
in American cities.[8]

# Effect of Tax Programs

## Tax Program Details

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) subsidizes the acquisition,
construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing for low-
and moderate-income tenants. The LIHTC was enacted as part of the 1986
Tax Reform Act and has been modified numerous times. Since the
mid-1990s, the LIHTC program has supported the construction or
rehabilitation of about 110,000 affordable rental units each year
(though there was a steep drop-off after the Great Recession of 2008-09)
over 2 million units in all since its inception.

The federal government issues tax credits to state and territorial
governments. State housing agencies then award the credits to private
developers of affordable rental housing projects through a competitive
process. Developers generally sell the credits to private investors to
obtain funding. Once the housing project is placed in service
(essentially, made available to tenants), investors can claim the LIHTC
over a 10-year period.[9]

On the last day of its 2000 session, Congress created the New Markets
Tax Credit program, part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of
2000, to encourage investment in low-income communities. The program is
designed to generate $15 billion in new private sector investments in
low-income communities.

Qualified Community Development Entities (CDE) will apply to the CDFI
Fund for an award of new markets tax credits. The CDE will then seek
taxpayers to make Qualifying Equity Investments in the CDE. The CDE will
in turn be required to use substantially all of the qualifying equity
investments to make qualified low-income community investments (QLICI)
in/to qualified active low-income businesses (QALICBs) located in
low-income communities. The taxpayer will be eligible to claim a tax
credit equal to 5 percent of its equity investment in the CDE for each
of the first three years and a 6 percent credit for each of the next
four years (39 percent total).[10]

The goal of both of these programs was to help distressed communities by
providing billions of dollars in funding to improve housing,
infrastructure, and neighborhoods. In addition to the median home value
dependent variable, the researchers have chosen to measure
gentrification as a means to determine neighborhood progress. The term
gentrification means, “the process of renewal and rebuilding accompanied
by the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating
areas that often displaces poor residents.”[11] The purpose of using
gentrification as a measurement, despite the potentially
controversiality, is to find other variables that might indicate that
the tax programs are having their intended effect - so that we do not
myopically focus on median home value to the exclusion of other
attributes.
